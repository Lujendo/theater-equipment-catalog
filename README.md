## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js and npm (for local development without Docker)

### Running with Docker

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd theater
   ```

2. Build and start the Docker container:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

   **IMPORTANT**: To rebuild the containers without losing data:
   ```
   # Stop the containers
   docker-compose stop

   # Rebuild the app container only
   docker-compose build app

   # Start the containers again
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   **WARNING**: Do not use `docker-compose down -v` as it will remove the volumes and all data. Instead, use:
   ```
   # To stop and remove containers without removing volumes
   docker-compose down

   # To rebuild and start
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000

### Running Locally (Without Docker)
